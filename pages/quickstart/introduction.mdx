# Intro to Journeys

At the heart of Alloy's Identity Decisioning platform are Workflows and Journeys. Workflows outputs attributes of an applicant based on their rules configuration.
Journeys stitch together workflows and output a single, final decision for a given applicant, managing applicant state and abstracting a lot of the hard things about identity decisioning.

If you've been in contact with our team, you will have received a fully configured Journey that you can integrate with right away. If you do not have a Journey configured, please reach out to us [here](https://www.alloy.com/contact).

# Using Alloy SDK

Alloy SDK is a way for you to render UI to collect various user informations such as documents (passport, driver's license, ..etc). With Alloy SDK, you can render the forms you need with just few lines of code.

Before we start the integration, if you're curious what Alloy SDK UI looks like, feel free to play around with our SDK in our [playground](/sdk). 

To initialize the Alloy SDK, you need these information:
```
const alloyInitParams = {
    key: {your_sdk_key},
    journeyApplicationToken: {journey_application_token from the api call to create journey application},
    journeyToken:{journey_token from Journey's page in the dashboard},
    documents: ['license', 'passport'], // list of documents you want to collect.
    selfie: true,
};

```

The `journeyApplicationToken` will change depending on which Journey application you are wanting to supply the document information to.

You can simply initialize Alloy SDK in your JS/TS client side application by doing 

``` 
import alloy from '@alloyidentity/web-sdk' 

 alloy.init(alloyInitParams);
```

and whenever you need to render the UI, you can do 

```
alloy.open(callbackFunction, anchorElementID)
```

The `callbackFunction` takes in a function that takes as a parameter document tokens (output of document verification process) and runs this function after the Form closes.
The `anchorElementID` is optional field if you want to anchor the UI Form to a specific element.

if you need to close the UI, you can do 

```
alloy.close()
```

Alloy SDK automatically moves your journey application forward on completion of the document verification so you don't have to worry about doing a PUT in this case.

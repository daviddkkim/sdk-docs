# Next Steps

We just walked through how to integrate with Journeys and Alloy SDK. This is only a glimpse of what the Alloy platform can do.
As mentioned in the [How it works]('/quickstart/how-it-works') page, there are many other ways to interact with Alloy platform and your usecase might require them.

<Box css={{
    width:'100%',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    margin: '$6 0'
}}>
<StyledLink href={'/overview'}><Button color={ButtonColor.secondary} size={ButtonSize.large}> ‚Üê Home </Button></StyledLink>
</Box>

export default ({ children }) => <MainLayout>{children}</MainLayout>;

# Making your first API call

First, you'll need a workflow token and a workflow secret to get started. To get a workflow token and a workflow secret, follow these steps:
- Login to Alloy Dashboard.
- Click "Workflows" on the navigation to the left side to navigate to Workflows page.
- Once on the Workflows page, click on any of the workflows present to get to the Workflow details page.
- Right below the title of the page, you will see `Workflow Token` and `Workflow Secret`. These are the values you will need to authorize the API call. Save them for now.
- Click "Journeys" on the navigation to the left side to navigate to Journeys page.
- once on the Journeys page, you will see the configured Journey and it's `Journey Token`. This token is needed for the API call as well. Save it for now. 

Once you've retrieved the `Workflow Token` and `Workflow Secret` pair, use them to make an API call below using your preferred method. Couple things about the API call below: 
- Notice that the API URL starts with `sandbox.alloy.co`. This is because the call is going to a sandbox environment, which means this and that; if you want to make a call directly to prod API, use `alloy.co`.
- Notice that there is a `alloy-journey-application-sync: true` header. This ensures that you will receive a synchronous response. If you are looking to **render application UI** based on Journey API responses, we highly recommend you **use the synchronous API call** rather than reaching for other methods such as polling or our webhook.
- This API call sends in a single entity and all data needed at once. If you have a usecase in which you need to send data in a stream (for example, multiple entities application where you don't have all information at once), click [here]("/overview") to learn more.

With the above API call, you should have received a response that looks something like the following:

``` 
{
  journey_application_token: :application token,
  status: 'pending',  
  sandbox: true,
  created_at: 1660502030212,
  updated_at: 1660502030240,
  closed_at: null,
  recent_outcome: null,
  complete_outcome: null,
  journey_application_status: 'pending',
  is_archived: false,
  archived_at: null,
  _embedded: {
    child_entities: [ [Object] ],
    entity_applications: [ [Object] ],
    entity: {
      external_entity_identifier: null,
      name: null,
      token: 'G-1mgwUbz7sIjcw9QOJjw3',
      type: 'group'
    },
    events: [ [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object] ],
    journey: {
      journey_name: 'Onboarding + Step Up DocV',
      journey_token: :journeyToken,
      journey_version_num: '3',
      _links: [Object]
    }
  },
  _links: {
    self: {
      href: '/v1/journeys/:journeyToken/applications/:application token'
    }
  }
}
```

With that, you've made your first API call to Alloy Platform, which created an application to your journey üéâ. 
If you remember from the diagram in the previous page, from here on out, you will have to figure out how you want to handle the different statuses a journey application could be in.

Let's figure out what statuses Journey Applications can be in and how you might handle that in the next page!
